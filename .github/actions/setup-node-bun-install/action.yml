# ✍️ Description:
# This is a composite action, which means it can be used in other actions.
# It is used in almost all workflows to set up the environment and install dependencies.
# Updating  the package manager or Node version here will be reflected in all workflows.

# 👀 Example usage:
#       - name : 📦 Setup Node + bun + install deps
#         uses: ./.github/actions/setup-node-bun-install
